## Features ‚ú®
- User Authentication: There is authentication for 3 different types of users: Participants, Judges, Admin.
- Participant Dashboard: The portal will be used by participants to submit presentations, youtube links and github links after each round.
- Judges Dashboard: It will be used by judges to view all the submissions after each round
- Automation Scripts: Since the event is hosted on Unstop, hence we receive the registrations from Unstop. The portal provides automation scripts to automatically generate user registrations on our platform from the data received from Unstop. We also have automation scripts to update/restrict the team's access to the portal after each round based on weather they are selected for next round or not
